 Let’s review this section’s main concepts and discoveries:

    The store allowed us to represent the list of characters and selected heroes in one overall object. Ultimately, every component that needs to has access to this store, through the react-redux connect function.

    The action creators included addCharacterById and removeCharacterById. They returned actions - objects with a type, and data for the reducers to handle.

    Reducers provided guidelines on how to add and remove characters to the store. It did so by returning new instances of both the characters and heroes array through different action.type cases.

    MapStateToProps, the first parameter of the connect function, described what parts of the redux store to make accessible within the component’s props object.

    MapDispatchToProps, the second parameter of the connect function, described what action creators to bind to the component’s props object.

 Next, if you want to extend Supersquad, here’s a few challenges to consider:

    Have the items in both CharacterList and HeroList display the strength, intelligence, and speed stats for each character.

    Add 5 or more characters to the characters.json data file.

    Add a clear all function to the HeroList. This would involve creating a new action type, action creator, and reducer.
